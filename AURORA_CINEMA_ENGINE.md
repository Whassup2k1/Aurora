## Cinema starts with the experience

Great playback should disappear into the background, leaving the movie, the sound and the story in the foreground.

**Aurora Cinema Engine (ACE)** is the evolving playback technology behind Aurora's cinematic experiences. It is being developed as part of the same self-hosted environment as **Aurora Server**, **Aurora Desktop**, **Aurora Experience** and **Aurora Android**.

The goal is straightforward: **beautiful picture quality, immersive audio and a responsive player** — with your own media library on infrastructure you control.

## ✨ Playback highlights

The following capabilities have been reported working in Aurora's **private tests**. Results depend on the source file, client device, operating system, display, audio equipment and playback path.

| Capability | Private-test status | What it means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dolby Vision** | 🧪 Observed working | Dolby Vision playback on tested compatible equipment and media paths |
| **HDR10+** | 🧪 Observed working | Dynamic HDR playback where the complete device and media chain supports it |
| **HDR / HDR10** | 🧪 Under validation | High-dynamic-range video workflows across supported playback environments |
| **Dolby Atmos** | 🧪 Observed working | Immersive audio playback on tested compatible audio paths and hardware |
| **Fullscreen cinematic playback** | 🧪 Functional internally | A viewing-focused interface across Aurora's evolving clients |
| **Media compatibility and seeking** | 🚧 Ongoing development | Continued work on format handling, navigation and reliable playback |
| **Cross-device consistency** | 🚧 Ongoing validation | Refinement across desktop, fullscreen and Android environments |

> **Compatibility note:** A movie containing a Dolby Vision, HDR10+ or Dolby Atmos track does not automatically mean every screen or sound system can reproduce that format. Some devices may use a fallback format or a different playback route. Format-specific behavior will be documented after broader validation.

**Dolby**, **Dolby Atmos** and **Dolby Vision** are trademarks of Dolby Laboratories. **HDR10+** is a trademark associated with HDR10+ Technologies, LLC. References to these technologies describe test observations only; they do **not** imply certification, licensing, endorsement or a partnership.

## 📱 Designed for a lightweight Android experience

Aurora Android has demonstrated an application memory footprint of **approximately 200 MB in one private test environment**.

| Android observation | Current information |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Observed app memory** | **~200 MB** in the reported test setup |
| **Measurement scope** | A single internal observation; not a maximum or guaranteed value |
| **Future optimization** | Under consideration as development continues |
| **Device-wide memory / server memory** | Not represented by this figure |

This is a promising early result, but memory use can vary with the Android device, operating system, media, caching and playback activity. There is **no announced target** for a lower memory footprint yet.

## 🖥️ One ecosystem, different screens

| Aurora component | How it connects to the cinema experience |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Aurora Server** | Hosts and delivers your personal media library |
| **Aurora Desktop** | Provides a full media-browsing and playback experience |
| **Aurora Experience** | Offers immersive, large-screen, fullscreen navigation |
| **Aurora Android** | Brings a related viewing experience to supported Android environments |
| **Aurora Cinema Engine** | Evolves the playback experience and media-handling capabilities across supported paths |

Aurora Experience and Aurora Android share a closely related visual experience, while remaining subject to different device and platform capabilities.

## 🔧 What we're refining

Without publishing internal implementation details, current development and validation priorities include:

- Playback startup and reliability
- Seeking, stream handling and error recovery
- Compatibility across video and audio formats
- HDR and immersive-audio behavior on supported hardware
- Android device performance and resource use
- Consistent controls and user experience between Aurora clients

These are areas of ongoing work, **not** release commitments or blanket compatibility claims.

## 🔒 Your media. Your server. Your world.

ACE is part of Aurora's **local-first, self-hosted philosophy**. Your personal media library remains on storage managed by you. Some optional artwork, metadata and other integrations may contact external services when configured.

Aurora does not provide commercial films, television channels, streaming subscriptions or media rights. Users are responsible for their own content and sources.
